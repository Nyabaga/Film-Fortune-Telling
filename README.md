## Business problem

 > Business Problem : Microsoft wants to start a film company
 
 Microsoft decides to venture into the world of movie production, but they're new to the game. I have been given a task  to figure out what kinds of movies are popular right now. Your job is to dig into the data and give them advice on what types of movies they should focus on making. With my insights, Microsoft can make smart decisions about their film projects and increase their chances of success in the industry.
 
 ## Business Understanding
 As a data scientist delving into the movie industry, it's evident that this field is complex, involving various players and factors shaping a film's success. Crucial aspects include script caliber, celebrity allure, promotional tactics, release timing, and audience genre preferences. Action and adventure flicks usually fare well, whereas specialized genres like documentaries may attract a smaller audience. Our analysis integrates diverse data sources like box office data, social media metrics, and critical reviews, utilizing methodologies such as regression and sentiment analysis to uncover trends. For Microsoft's new movie studio, our aim is to utilize these insights to inform their film production strategies effectively. By grasping the nuances of the industry and employing data-driven approaches, Microsoft can optimize their movie lineup, ensuring greater success and profitability in this competitive arena.
 
 ## Data Understanding
 Our data is stored in a folder named zippedData. The data is sourced from a variety of movie aggregation sites:

~ Box Office Mojo
~ IMDB
~ Rotten Tomatoes
~ TheMovieDB

## Conclusion


## Next Steps
Here are other ideas to explore for future analysis:
~ **Segmentation**: Microsoft should consider segmenting their movies according to age and gender in order to meet the needs of their audience .
~**Include difference in the runtime of movies vs. ratings** :Does the duration of a movie always indicate its quality? This information would help Microsoft grasp how to create their own future "classics" and determine the optimal length for maximizing ratings.
