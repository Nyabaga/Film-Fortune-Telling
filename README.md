 > Business Problem : Microsoft wants to start a film company
 
 Microsoft decides to venture into the world of movie production, but they're new to the game. I have been given a task  to figure out what kinds of movies are popular right now. Your job is to dig into the data and give them advice on what types of movies they should focus on making. With my insights, Microsoft can make smart decisions about their film projects and increase their chances of success in the industry.
